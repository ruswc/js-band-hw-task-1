Homework 1
We have a new potential client, it’s one of the biggest logistics companies “JS Band Delivery”. It uses two types of transporting by trucks and by railway. The company has a plan to diversify transportation types and introduce new ones, such as Aero. That is why the system should be flexible to such type of changes. The client asked about Discovery phase on this stage. The result of this phase should be a POC of the tracking system that helps them to collect data about their own transport.
